The file naming processes in this folder is the same as that of the outputs found in 'outputs/model_runs/2000-2014/'

All outputs are run from July 2000-2014 to June 2014 with UKESM inputs, unless specified.

Extra: relative humidity ranges between 0 and 1. Units for lightning ignitions has been updated to take into account
the number of strikes hitting the surface.

Naming system:

obs_x - uses UKESM inputs apart from the specified variable(s), x, which use observational data.

jules_x - same as above, but uses jules inputs of the specified varialbe(s), x.
